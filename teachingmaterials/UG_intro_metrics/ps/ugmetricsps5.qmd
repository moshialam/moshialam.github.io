# Note:

This is an evolving problem set. Since we are using multiple classes to cover this topic, I will keep on adding questions as we go. You can get a head start on it as I keep on adding problems. Once the PS is complete I will post an announcement on Canvas. Please check back for updates.

## Simple 2x2 DiD

Use the .Rmd file that we used in class to load the cleaned Card and Krueger (1994) dataset from github remotes, and assign it to an object called `ckdata`. Load other associated libraries as needed. Prepare the data for estimation of the impact of the minimum wage increase policy on employment as we did in class. 

IMPORTANT: In all estimations, whenever you are interpreting your estimates, state all necessary assumptions for you to claim that the estimated effect is causal (i.e. identification assumptions).

### Question 1

Plot the data of starting wages by the state and the year (before and after the minimum wage increase). Comment on any patterns you observe.

### Question 2

- Re-estimate the simple 2x2 DiD model of the effect of minimum wage increase on employment that we did in class. Report and interpret the results. 
- How many unique food chains are in the data? 
- Estimate the simple 2x2 DiD model of the effect of minimum wage increase on employment with `chain` fixed effects. Report, compare and interpret the results.

### Question 3

- What are some additional control variables that you can add to the model? Re-estimate the DiD model with these additional controls. Report, compare and interpret the results. (Hint: Be mindful of the discussion of "bad controls" we discussed before the mid-term in class.)

### Question 4

- Did employers in NJ pass on the increased labor costs to consumers in the form of higher prices? Answer this question empirically.

## 2xT Event Study

Use the .Rmd file that we used in class to append `ckdata` with the additional years of data from 1990, 1991 and 1993 provided in the dataset `ck_additional_years.csv` on Canvas. Prepare the data for estimation of the impact of the minimum wage increase policy on employment as we did in class.

### Question 5

- Estimate an event study model of the effect of minimum wage increase on employment along with chain FE. Report and interpret the results. Plot the event study coefficients with 95% confidence intervals. Comment on any patterns you observe.

- What do the pre-treatment coefficients tell you about your main identification assumption?
