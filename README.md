Hi, welcome to the GitHub page where my website is hosted. 

Originally, I had built my "old" website using resources from [academicpages/academicpages.github.io](academicpages/academicpages.github.io). Hence on top of this repo it shows that it is forked from academicpages/academicpages.github.io.

The current website is built using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/confluence.html) following the [guide provided on Quarto's website](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) and hosted on GitHub pages [following the instructions herein](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html) with the same name as my old website.
