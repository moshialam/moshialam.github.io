Students are free to use any laguage of their preference--Stata, R, Julia, Python, Matlab etc.
Most students use the statistical software, Stata for the analysis they conduct for their term paper.

Besides google search being a very good friend while picking up any language, here are some resources on **Stata** from the internet that may be useful for students. 
1. [Social Science Computing Center at UW-Madison](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/statistics/stata/)
2. [Data and Statistical services at Princeton](https://dss.princeton.edu/training/)
3. [Advanced Research computing at UCLA](https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/stata/)
4. [Project management in Stata](https://sscc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/dws/data_wrangling_stata8.htm)
5. [Transitioning between Stata and R](https://stata2r.github.io)

Most of them, have corresponding pages for R as well.
