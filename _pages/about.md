Hi! Welcome to my website!

I am a  Post-Doctoral Research Fellow at the [Department of Economics, Queen's University](https://www.econ.queensu.ca/). 

I am a labor economist. I received my PhD in Economics from the [Department of Economics, University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://econ.wisc.edu/) in 2021. Most of my current work revolves around economic inequality resulting due to differences in preferences, beliefs and information in various contexts. 

*I am on the 2023-24 job market and will be available for interviews.*

For more details on my work please see my [Research page](https://moshialam.github.io/research/) and [CV](/papers/Alam_MdMoshiUl_CV.pdf).

**Research Fields:**
  Labor Economics, Public Economics and Applied Econometrics.
