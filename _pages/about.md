Hi! Welcome to my website!

I am a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow at the [Department of Economics, Queen's University](https://www.econ.queensu.ca/). I received my PhD in Economics from the [Department of Economics, University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://econ.wisc.edu/) in 2021. 

I am a Labor and Public economist studying topics of discrimination and inequality with a focus on how preferences and beliefs affect economic outcomes. Depending on the question of interest, I use different methods in my research combining both design-based and structural models, using variations from experiments and natural experiments.

For more details on my work please see my [CV](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qx054cgdv99412f/Alam_MdMoshiUl_CV.pdf?dl=0) and [Research page](https://moshialam.github.io/research/).

**Research Interests:**
  Labor, Public, Development Economics and Applied Econometrics.
