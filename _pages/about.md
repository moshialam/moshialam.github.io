Hi! Welcome to my website!

I am a  Post-Doctoral Research Fellow at the [Department of Economics, Queen's University](https://www.econ.queensu.ca/). I received my PhD in Economics from the [Department of Economics, University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://econ.wisc.edu/) in 2021. 

I am a labor economist. Most of my current work revolves around economic inequality resulting due to differences in preferences, beleifs and information in various contexts. For more details on my work please see my [Research page](https://moshialam.github.io/research/) and [CV](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fxd2smq50hzwkab/Alam_MdMoshiUl_CV.pdf?dl=0). 

**Research Fields:**
  Labor Economics, Public Economics and Applied Econometrics.
