Hi! Welcome to my website!

I am a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow at the [Department of Economics, Queen's University](https://www.econ.queensu.ca/). I received my PhD in Economics from the [Department of Economics, University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://econ.wisc.edu/). 

I am a Labor and Public economist studying topics of discrimination and inequality with a focus on how preferences and beliefs affect economic outcomes. Depending on the question of interest I use different methods of both design-based as well as structural estimation using variations from experiments and natural experiments.

**Research Interests:**
  Labor, Public, Development Economics and Applied Econometrics.
