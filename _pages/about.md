Hi! Welcome to my website!

I am a  Post-Doctoral Research Fellow at the [Department of Economics, Queen's University](https://www.econ.queensu.ca/). In the summer of 2022, I will be visiting University of Wisconsin-Madison.

I am a labor economist. I received my PhD in Economics from the [Department of Economics, University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://econ.wisc.edu/) in 2021. Most of my current work revolves around economic inequality resulting due to differences in preferences, beliefs and information in various contexts. 

For more details on my work please see my [Research page](https://moshialam.github.io/research/) and [CV](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fxd2smq50hzwkab/Alam_MdMoshiUl_CV.pdf?dl=0). 

**Research Fields:**
  Labor Economics, Public Economics and Applied Econometrics.
