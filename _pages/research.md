My interests primarily revolves around answering applied microeconomic questions on economic inequality. Depending on the question of interest, I use either reduced-form methods, or structural models, or both.

  </summary>
        Many countries are committed to achieving pay equity, with the aim of reducing wage disparities that typically average around 15% in hourly earnings between men and women performing the same job within the same organization. In 2018, Portugal revised its pay equity legislation to impose pay-equity policy targeting larger firms, imposing fines on those that maintained a gender wage gap exceeding five percent. Using detailed employeeemployer data and an event study design, we examine the immediate labor market effects of this legislation and reveal significant unintended consequences. In aggregate, we find that the number of women experiencing reductions in wage growth far exceeded those who saw increased wage growth. Specifically, within firms with existing wage gaps exceeding five percent, the gap decreased by an average of 13%, primarily due to reduced male wage growth. Conversely, firms with gaps below five percent witnessed a more than 25% increase in the wage gap, primarily due to larger reductions in female wage growth. Moreover, among a small proportion of workers not covered by collective bargaining agreements, the law reduced wage gaps by one-fifth, driven by increased female wage growth. We discuss the mechanisms behind these findings centered around how the law eliminates ambiguity regarding the consequences of gender disparities by setting a target wage gap for all treated firms.

  </summary>
  Tight labor markets are associated with high costs of worker-turnover. In such settings, firms might put significant weight on whom workers want to work for, while deciding promotions. Should workers prefer not to work for female managers, it could lower the chances of females being promoted. Using an information experiment and a structural model, in this paper, we provide novel evidence on the distribution of workers' preferences on manager gender and their beliefs on managers' mentoring ability, which affects their job search and choice. In the absence of information on manager quality, workers are indifferent to manager gender. However, upon receiving information on manager mentorship ability, workers prefer to work for female managers---as exhibited by their willingness to forgo 1.3--2.2% of average annual wages. Hence, absent additional information on mentorship skill, workers on average believe that female managers' mentoring ability is worse than male managers', with the magnitude of this evaluation corresponding to a wage differential of 1.6% of average annual wages. These averages mask rich heterogeneity. We find that 60% of workers prefer to work for female managers, and in the absence of information on mentorship ability, 62% believe male managers to be better mentors. An ex-post survey directly eliciting worker beliefs corroborates this finding. We find policy-relevant heterogeneity by maternal education level, parental employment status and worker major. Our results imply, the distribution of worker preferences could be used to test for discriminatory practices by the firm.

  </summary>
  Health hazards due to open defecation are most prominent in India. Females benefit from toilets in households more than males. In this paper we estimate the impact of increased inheritance rights of females on the presence of a toilet in the household. Daughters being usually married away to the household of the groom, available household level nationally representative data do not have all original (natal) household characteristics – which determines treatment eligibility. Under generic assumptions, we show that when the treatment is partially observed to the researcher, we can derive a lower bound on the average treatment effect in a difference in differences framework. We estimate that the policy increased the probability of the presence of a toilet in the household a woman is married into, by at least 4.3% points. We uncover conditional treatment effects by the age of the daughter at the time of policy implementation and find it to be the largest for the group of females who were the youngest at the time of policy implementation.

      </summary>
      This paper provides new evidence on the time trend in shared physical custody after divorce in the U.S., using eight waves of data from the Current Population Survey - Child Support Supplement. We find that the likelihood of shared custody more than doubled between divorces that occurred before 1985 and those in 2010-2014, from 12% to 28%. We show that non-Hispanic Whites and those who are more socioeconomically advantaged are more likely to have shared custody. Using more formal methods we show that the increase cannot be explained by changes in the characteristics of those divorcing; instead, we infer that this is the result of changing norms and policies that favor shared custody. Finally, this paper complements previous analyses using court record data from Wisconsin and shows that while the rate of shared custody in Wisconsin is higher than the national rate, a large increase over time has occurred in the nation as well as in Wisconsin. These changing patterns have important implications for children’s living arrangements and for the parental investments that children receive after their parents’ divorce.
