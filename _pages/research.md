    In this paper we answer a novel question of whether preferences and beliefs of employees on managers gender and quality, contribute towards generating glass-ceilings for females at the managerial level. If employees do not want to work for female managers, then they would need a wage premium to do so. This would dis-incentivize firm executives to promote or hire females as managersthus generating glass-ceilings at managerial levels, resulting from such employee choices. In order to estimate employee preferences and beliefs, we design and conduct a novel information experiment within a hypothetical job choice survey. In absence of information on manager quality, employees are indifferent between male and female managers. However, given information on manager quality, employees prefer to work for female managers. Using a structural model of job choice, we estimate employees are willing to give up 1.3-2.2% of average annual wages to work for female managers, on average. Hence in the absence of additional information on manager quality, employees believed female managers to be worse in quality. Estimating the model for each employee reveals that 60% prefer to work for female managers, and in absence of information on manager quality 62% believed male managers to be of better quality. We corroborate this result of negative beliefs on female manager quality in an expost survey where we directly elicit employee beliefs. The results suggest that glass ceilings for females at the managerial level, driven by discrimination by firm executiveswho decide on promotioncould be potentially underestimated.
