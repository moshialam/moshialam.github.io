- *Job Market Paper*     [**Employee Side Discrimination: Beliefs and Preferences--Evidence from an Information Experiment on Job-seekers**](https://ssc.wisc.edu/~alam4/Alam_JMP.pdf), with Mehreen Mookerjee and Sanket Roy    (*Updated draft coming  soon*)
    <details style="font-size:80%; background-color:floralwhite;">  <summary style="color:blue; font-family:courier; font-size:100%;"> Abstract</summary> In this paper we provide novel evidence on the distribution of workers' preferences on manager's gender and their beleifs on manager's mentorship quality.  We design and conduct a novel within-worker information experiment and embed it in a hypothetical job choice survey for job-seekers. In absence of information on manager quality, on average workers are indifferent between male and female managers. However, given information on manager mentorship quality, workers prefer to work for female managers--willing to give up 1.3-2.2% of average annual wages to work for female managers, on average. Estimating our job choice model for each worker we find 60% of workers prefer to work for female managers, and in the absence of information on manager quality 62% believed male managers to be of better quality. We do not find evidence of such negative beliefs on female manager mentorship among workers whose mothers are more educated than their fathers and among female workers who have majored in science. We corroborate this result of negative beliefs on female manager quality in an ex-post survey where we directly elicit worker beliefs. The results suggest that glass ceilings for females at the managerial level, driven by discrimination by firm executives--who decide on promotion--could be potentially underestimated. </details>

- **Female Inheritance Rights and Household Sanitation**, with [Monica](https://sites.google.com/view/monicauwmadison) (*Draft coming soon.*)
    <details style="font-size:80%; background-color:floralwhite;">  <summary style="color:blue; font-family:courier;"> Abstract</summary>  Health hazards due to open defecation are most prominent in India. Females benefit from toilets in households more than males. In this paper we estimate the impact of increased inheritance rights of females on the presence of a toilet in the household. Daughters being usually married away to the household of the groom, available household level nationally representative data do not have all original (natal) household characteristics – which determines treatment eligibility. Under generic assumptions, we show that when the treatment is partially observed to the researcher, we can derive a lower bound on the average treatment effect in a difference in differences framework. We estimate that the policy increased the probability of the presence of a toilet in the household a woman is married into, by at least 4.3% points. We uncover conditional treatment effects by the age of the daughter at the time of policy implementation and find it to be the largest for the group of females who were the youngest at the time of policy implementation.  </details> 
        
- **Increases in Shared Custody after Divorce** with Daniel Meyer and Marcy Carlson (_R&R in Demographic Research_)
     <details style="font-size:80%; background-color:floralwhite;">  <summary style="color:blue; font-family:courier;"> Abstract</summary>  This paper provides new evidence on the time trend in shared physical custody after divorce in the U.S., using eight waves of data from the Current Population Survey - Child Support Supplement. We find that the likelihood of shared custody more than doubled between divorces that occurred before 1985 and those in 2010-2014, from 12% to 28%. We show that non-Hispanic Whites and those who are more socioeconomically advantaged are more likely to have shared custody. Using more formal methods we show that the increase cannot be explained by changes in the characteristics of those divorcing; instead, we infer that this is the result of changing norms and policies that favor shared custody. Finally, this paper complements previous analyses using court record data from Wisconsin and shows that while the rate of shared custody in Wisconsin is higher than the national rate, a large increase over time has occurred in the nation as well as in Wisconsin. These changing patterns have important implications for children’s living arrangements and for the parental investments that children receive after their parents’ divorce  </details>
