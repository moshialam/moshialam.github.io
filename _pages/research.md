In such settings, firms might put significant weight on whom workers want to work for, while deciding promotions. Should workers prefer not to work for female managers, it could lower the chances of females being promoted. In this paper, we provide novel evidence on the distribution of workers' preferences on manager gender and their beliefs on managers' mentoring ability, which affects their job search and choice. In the absence of information on manager quality, workers are indifferent to manager gender. However, upon receiving information on manager mentorship ability, workers prefer to work for female managers---as exhibited by their willingness to forgo 1.3--2.2\% of average annual wages. Hence, absent additional information on mentorship skill, workers on average believe that female managers' mentoring ability is worse than male managers', with the magnitude of this evaluation corresponding to a wage differential of 1.6\% of average annual wages. These averages mask rich heterogeneity. We find that 60\% of workers prefer to work for female managers, and in the absence of information on mentorship ability, 62\% believe male managers to be better mentors. An ex-post survey directly eliciting worker beliefs corroborates this finding. We find policy-relevant heterogeneity by maternal education level, parental employment status and worker major. Our results imply, the distribution of worker preferences could be used to test for discriminatory practices by the firm. </details>

- **Female Inheritance Rights and Household Sanitation** (with Monica Agarwal) (*Updated draft coming soon.*)
     <details style="font-size:80%; font-family:Verdana; width =20%;">  <summary style="color:blue; font-family:courier; font-size:80%; font-family:Verdana; width=80%;"> Abstract </summary>  Health hazards due to open defecation are most prominent in India. Females benefit from toilets in households more than males. In this paper we estimate the impact of increased inheritance rights of females on the presence of a toilet in the household. Daughters being usually married away to the household of the groom, available household level nationally representative data do not have all original (natal) household characteristics – which determines treatment eligibility. Under generic assumptions, we show that when the treatment is partially observed to the researcher, we can derive a lower bound on the average treatment effect in a difference in differences framework. We estimate that the policy increased the probability of the presence of a toilet in the household a woman is married into, by at least 4.3% points. We uncover conditional treatment effects by the age of the daughter at the time of policy implementation and find it to be the largest for the group of females who were the youngest at the time of policy implementation.  </details>

    <details style="font-size:80%; font-family:Verdana; width =20%;">  <summary style="color:blue; font-family:courier; font-size:80%; font-family:Verdana; width=80%;"> Abstract</summary>  This paper provides new evidence on the time trend in shared physical custody after divorce in the U.S., using eight waves of data from the Current Population Survey - Child Support Supplement. We find that the likelihood of shared custody more than doubled between divorces that occurred before 1985 and those in 2010-2014, from 12% to 28%. We show that non-Hispanic Whites and those who are more socioeconomically advantaged are more likely to have shared custody. Using more formal methods we show that the increase cannot be explained by changes in the characteristics of those divorcing; instead, we infer that this is the result of changing norms and policies that favor shared custody. Finally, this paper complements previous analyses using court record data from Wisconsin and shows that while the rate of shared custody in Wisconsin is higher than the national rate, a large increase over time has occurred in the nation as well as in Wisconsin. These changing patterns have important implications for children’s living arrangements and for the parental investments that children receive after their parents’ divorce  </details>
