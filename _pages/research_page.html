        Tight labor markets are associated with high costs of worker-turnover. In such settings, firms might put significant weight on whom workers want to work for, while deciding promotions. Should workers prefer not to work for female managers, it could lower the chances of females being promoted. In this paper, we provide novel evidence on the distribution of workers' preferences on manager gender and their beliefs on managers' mentoring ability, which affects their job search and choice. In the absence of information on manager quality, workers are indifferent to manager gender. However, upon receiving information on manager mentorship ability, workers prefer to work for female managers---as exhibited by their willingness to forgo 1.3--2.2% of average annual wages. Hence, absent additional information on mentorship skill, workers on average believe that female managers' mentoring ability is worse than male managers', with the magnitude of this evaluation corresponding to a wage differential of 1.6% of average annual wages. These averages mask rich heterogeneity. We find that 60% of workers prefer to work for female managers, and in the absence of information on mentorship ability, 62% believe male managers to be better mentors. An ex-post survey directly eliciting worker beliefs corroborates this finding. We find policy-relevant heterogeneity by maternal education level, parental employment status, and worker major. Our results imply that the distribution of worker preferences could be used to test for discriminatory practices by the firm.
