    "text": "Email    CV    Scholar    \n\nHi! I am a labor economist. My research interests are in answering microeconomic questions on economic inequality in Labor and Public Economics. Depending on the question, I use either design-based, or model-based methods, or both. I received my PhD in Economics, from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Starting Fall 2024, I will join Clark University, as an Assistant Professor of Economics.\n\n\n Working papers\n\nEmployee-Side Discrimination: Beliefs and Preferences (PhD JMP)\n\nwith Mehreen Mookerjee and Sanket Roy  [+Abstract] \n\nR&R at Quantitative Economics\n\n\nLabor Market Consequences of Pay-Equity Laws (Post-doc JMP)\n\nwith Steve Lehrer and Nuno Souso Pereira  [+Abstract] \n\nUpdated draft coming soon!\n\n\nFemale Inheritance Rights and Household Sanitation\n\nwith Monica Agarwal  [+Abstract] \n\nUpdated draft coming soon!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Publications/Accepted\n\n\n“Increases in shared custody after divorce in the United States.”\n\nwith Daniel Meyer and Marcia Carlson.

We find that the likelihood of shared custody more than doubled between divorces that occurred before 1985 and those in 2010-2014, from 12% to 28%. We show that non-Hispanic Whites and those who are more socioeconomically advantaged are more likely to have shared custody. Using more formal methods we show that the increase cannot be explained by changes in the characteristics of those divorcing; instead, we infer that this is the result of changing norms and policies that favor shared custody. Finally, this paper complements previous analyses using court record data from Wisconsin and shows that while the rate of shared custody in Wisconsin is higher than the national rate, a large increase over time has occurred in the nation as well as in Wisconsin. These changing patterns have important implications for children’s living arrangements and for the parental investments that children receive after their parents’ divorce."
