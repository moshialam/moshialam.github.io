    "text": "Email    CV    Scholar      BlueSky \n\nHi!😊 I am a labor economist. My research interests are in answering microeconomic questions on economic inequality in Labor and Public Economics. Depending on the question, I use either design-based, or model-based methods, or both. I received my PhD in Economics, from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\n\n\n Working papers\n\nEmployee-Side Discrimination: Beliefs and Preferences (PhD JMP)\n\nwith Mehreen Mookerjee and Sanket Roy  [+Abstract] \n\nR&R at Quantitative Economics\n\n\nLabor Market Consequences of Pay-Equity Laws (Post-doc JMP)\n\nwith Steven Lehrer and Nuno Souso Pereira  [+Abstract] \n\nUpdated Dec ’24  [Under review] \n\nThe Unintended Benefits of Women’s Empowerment on Household Sanitation\n\nwith Monica Agarwal  [+Abstract]   [ SSRN]\n\nUpdated Dec ’24  [Under review] \n\n\n\n\n\n Publications/Accepted\n\n“Increases in shared custody after divorce in the United States.”\n\nwith Daniel Meyer and Marcia Carlson.

We find that the likelihood of shared custody more than doubled between divorces that occurred before 1985 and those in 2010-2014, from 12% to 28%. We show that non-Hispanic Whites and those who are more socioeconomically advantaged are more likely to have shared custody. Using more formal methods we show that the increase cannot be explained by changes in the characteristics of those divorcing; instead, we infer that this is the result of changing norms and policies that favor shared custody. Finally, this paper complements previous analyses using court record data from Wisconsin and shows that while the rate of shared custody in Wisconsin is higher than the national rate, a large increase over time has occurred in the nation as well as in Wisconsin. These changing patterns have important implications for children’s living arrangements and for the parental investments that children receive after their parents’ divorce."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Many of us use cloud based services to sync important files. These services are not version controlling systems. If you have been use cloud based services to sync your files like Dropbox, it is recommended not to have a git repo inside a Dropbox folder for reasons described here, [here] and here or ensure Dropbox ignores the files that could cause conflicts with git. In short, this is how I do this:\n\nI only use git to version control my code. All other documentation that do not need version control for example, related papers, data etc. live in a project folder inside Dropbox.\nIf I am the only person writing the code, I either tell Dropbox to igone the code directory if it is living in Dropbox, or I keep it outside of Dropbox. The latter works best if you are the sole person working on the code. The former is useful only for project organization—given that data and other documentation is living in the Dropbox folder, it is only convinent to also have the code directory inside the same project folder.\nIf I am collaborating with someone on code and they do not want to use git then I do not version control our code in the Dropbox folder. Rather, I keep a separate folder with all my codes in a non-Dropbox folder and version control that. At the end of each day, I then sync them with the Dropbox folder. This is only possible because my scripts are typically different from my collaborators script."

Updates Project.toml: It adds DataFrames to the list of dependencies. 2. Updates Manifest.toml: It records the exact version of DataFrames and its dependencies to ensure reproducibility."

The solution to this is a careful force merge of the two branches:\ngit checkout main\ngit merge master --allow-unrelated-histories\n\n\n\nAfter setting up the remote repository, you can stage and commit your files. Itypically do this on the fly using VSCode default GUI.\n\nClick on the Source Control icon in the left sidebar in VSCode.\nYou should see all your files listed as untracked. Click on the + icon next to each file to stage them, or click + next to Changes to stage all files.\nEnter a commit message in the text box at the top.\nClick on the checkmark icon to commit your staged changes.\nPush your changes to the remote repository."
