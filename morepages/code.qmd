# Code for research

Here are the codes of some `julia`/`R` functions that I have implemented in my research. There may be more efficient routines.  I have often found `julia` to be quite fast if the data or the parameter space is large. And I like coding in it. 

I have tried to make them context agnostic. However, they may not be fully general, some almost by construction. Hence these are not packages. Please feel free to use them, or report a bug if you find one!

- Quantile regressions with FE (Canay 2011) (`julia`)
- Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm (`julia`)
- Parametric shrinkage with heteroskedastic errors (`julia`)
- Non-parametric shrinkage with heteroskedastic errors and shape restrictions (`R`)
- Event studies with interacted FE (`julia`)


# Code for teaching

Most of these are in `R`. Their objective is to simulate data with failures in assumptions required for identification, or for inference and show what happens. Some of them are simply hard-coding the estimator instead of using a package which I have found to be helpful being able to compare various estimators.

- Simple linear regression
- Central Limit Theorem
- Frisch-Waugh-Lovell theorem
- IV and 2SLS
- Weak IV vs Strong IV
