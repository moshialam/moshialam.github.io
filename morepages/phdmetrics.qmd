## Course Description

This is a core PhD level econometrics course. I am not an Econometric theorist, but I think a lot about Econometrics and pay attention to it in my work. Hence, my teaching of this course may differ from a traditional econometrician. My goal here is to get you ready for second year applied econometrics course sequence of design-based and structural methods, and ensure certain results and style of approaching econometric proofs are at your fingertips. 


I will mostly follow [Bruce Hansen](https://econ.wisc.edu/staff/hansen-bruce/)'s *[Econometrics (2022)](https://users.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/econometrics/)*  textbook from which I have learnt a lot and found very useful. You would also find the first part of this book [Probability and Statistics for Economists (2022)](https://users.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/probability/) very useful too. I want to cover this course in mostly four big sub-parts: 

- Identification and Estimation
- Parametric estimation of linear models
- Large Sample Asymptotics and Inference, and Resampling based inference
- Non-parametrics
- Non-linear models
