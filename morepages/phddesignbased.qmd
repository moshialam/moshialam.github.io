## Course Description

This is the first course in a two-course sequence on applied econometrics at the PhD level, where we will cover design based methods for causal inference. The next course will cover model-based structural methods. 

There is no particular textbook for this course. We will mostly talk about the econometrics of methods and applications through papers. I will upload [slides on canvas](https://canvas.clarku.edu/courses/17807). Some additional useful references are:

## Course outline

- Potential outcomes framework
- Randomized controlled trials
- IV and Heterogeneous treatment effects
- Regression discontinuity designs
- FE, TWFE and Negative weights 
- Heterogeneity robust D-i-D and extensions
- Shrinkage Estimators
- Judge IV Designs
- Shift share IV
- Marginal Treatment Effects


## Readings

This reading list by no means is exhaustive. I have tried to add handbook chapters and survey papers since they are pretty well explanatory. Your objective in reading these papers is not only to understand the empirical application but also to understand how good authors write and structure their papers.

## Assessment

- **Problem Sets — 80%:** Four problem sets involving both theoretical derivations and empirical exercises + presentations. These are to be completed in groups of two.
    - Students can use their programming language of choice. I recommend R.
    - Students are expected to compile their assignments using LaTeX or equivalently in R Markdown. The final submission will involve both code and results in a single PDF with all tables properly formatted, variables properly labeled, and figures and tables with complete footnotes as if they are submitting the work to a journal.
    - I will also assign students topics for presentations/referee reports. 
- **Class  participation — 20%**
