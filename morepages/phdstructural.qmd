## Course Description

THis si the second part of a two-part sequence of Applied ecopnometrics at the PhD level. Here I cover structural models and econometric methods with a focus on some types of labor and public economics problems. Having a comprehensive course on structural models is nearly impossible since  structural work fine tune the model to the specific theory and context. The key lies in identification, which can ultimatley help us in doing counterfactuals. Hence, my emphasis will be mostly on identification, and primarily with discrete choice models (both static and dynamic) using estimation methods like MLE, GMM, SMM, and primarily indirect inference. I will cover some numerical optimization methods like gradient-based, derivative-free methods but mostly Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm. 

I do not find the discussions of whether structural models are better than design-based (reduced form) methods very constructive and hence will not engage in them. However, I will list some papers that discuss these. I like both, and have found both helpful in my work. In my view, both approaches have their own strengths, and it is cool to leverage best of both worlds.

No textbook as such---its mostly papers, but I found [Kenneth Train's *Discrete Choice Methods with Simulation*](https://eml.berkeley.edu/books/choice2.html) very helpful when I was learning discrete choice models for the first time. Depending on time I will also talk about some of my experience in improving computational efficiency in `julia`, and discuss some of the workflows that have worked for me.



## Assessment

- **Problem Sets — 80%:** Four problem sets + presentations. These are to be completed in groups of two.
    - Students can use their programming language of choice. I recommend `julia`, because of its computational advantages. However, `R` or `Python` are also fine.
    - Students are expected to compile their assignments using LaTeX. The final submission will involve both code and results in a single PDF with all tables properly formatted, variables properly labeled, and figures and tables with complete footnotes as if they are submitting the work to a journal.
    - I will also assign students topics for presentations/referee reports. 
- **Class attendance and participation — 20%**

##  Readings

The readings are in not a particular order, although I will talk about identification in general first and then how is strucutral (model-based) approach different from reduced form (design-based) approach. Things that are not in particular order maybe specific topics & estimation routines and papers applying them.
