## Coding resources
Students are free to use any language of their preference--Stata, R, julia, python, Matlab etc. Historically, most students have used Stata for the analysis they conduct in their term paper. However, starting 2025, I have shifted my  teaching of Econometrics, specifically implementation of methods---both simulation and estimation---to R. Below you will find old open-source resources as well as new resources that I recommend to  students.

_I strongly encourage students to use open-source languages like R, julia and python._

## R resources
1. [Stata2R](https://stata2r.github.io/): Students used to working in Stata will find this website incredibly useful if they want to transition to R. 
2. [R manuals from CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html) and the [CRAN homepage for R](https://www.r-project.org/)
3. [Master repo with various cheatsheets](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file)
4. [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/): I ask students to complete their problem sets in RMarkdown to have both code compilation as well as theoretical proofs written and executed in the same file. 
    - [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/): far more extensive, covers interactivity and additional features.
    - [Quarto markdown](https://quarto.org/) is another alternative that I really like for its versatility in languages. RMarkdown can also handle multiple languages (see [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/language-engines.html)) but I prefer the ease of customization of Quarto when it comes to multiple languages.
5. Package specific:
    - [`data.table`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-intro.html)
    - [`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)
    - [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)
    - [`fixest`](https://lrberge.github.io/fixest/)
    - [`AER` (*Applied Econometrics with R*)](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/AER/index.html)
    - [`binsreg`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/binsreg/binsreg.pdf)
    - [`vtable`](https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/vtable/index.html)
    - [`stargazer`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stargazer/vignettes/stargazer.pdf)
    - [more on `stargazer`](https://www.jakeruss.com/cheatsheets/stargazer/)
    - [`modelsummary`](https://modelsummary.com)


## Stata Resources
Besides google search being a very good friend while picking up any language, here are some resources on **Stata** from the internet that may be useful for students. 

1. [Social Science Computing Center at UW-Madison](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/statistics/stata/)
2. [Data and Statistical services at Princeton](https://dss.princeton.edu/training/)
3. [Advanced Research computing at UCLA](https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/stata/)
4. [Project management in Stata](https://sscc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/dws/data_wrangling_stata8.htm)
5. [Transitioning between Stata and R](https://stata2r.github.io)

Most of them, have corresponding pages for R as well.
